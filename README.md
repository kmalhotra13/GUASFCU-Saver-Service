# GUASFCU Applets

This will serve as the overarching repository for a set of applets I hope to develop to integrate into the Application of the Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union (GUASFCU). While the first applet is the one I hope to turn in (Round-up Savings), I do hope to continue developing more applets in the future.
